==========================================================================
Installing fax4CUPS is very easy:

0. Install efax (http://www.cce.com/efax/) or HylaFAX
(http://www.hylafax.org/). For HylaFAX you need also grep and sudo.

1. Install the man page.

2. Install the efax/hylafax scripts in the CUPS backend directory, for
instance, /usr/lib/cups/backend/; you can look at the first lines of the file
for configurable parameters (the fax script is provided for backward
compatibility only).  Make sure the executable paths are correct for your
system.

3. Install the PPD files efax.ppd/hylafax.ppd in the CUPS model directory, for
instance, /usr/share/cups/model, and create a new printer using the a suitable
backend (see the man page; the fax.ppd PPD file is provided for backward
compatibility only).

4. Restart the CUPS daemon (usually "/etc/rc.d/init.d/cups restart" as root
will do the job).
