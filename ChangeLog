1.1; 22 Mar 2007 Explicitly pass DISPLAY variable in backend script 
	         in showerror() function to avoid 'Default env_reset' in
		 /etc/sudoers.  Add check that 'sudo' command can be
		 executed, since some distributions are running CUPS under
		 'lp' user, instead of 'root' user.  Update documentation
		 to note that account that CUPS uses to run must be
		 enabled to run 'sudo' commands with NOPASSWD.  Correct
		 file permission problem (when CUPS runs with a
		 non-superuser account, it can't change the owner of the
		 temporary file used to access the fax by the GUI).
		 Add check for correct DISPLAY variable
		 
1.0; 28 Feb 2006 Tweak backend script to avoid problem with /etc/sudoers
		'Default env_reset' setting (thanks to Karl Schmidt)

0.7; 6 Nov 2004 Copy the file passed to CUPS backend as arg 6 to a temporary
		file so it is readable by all users; security levels on some
		systems prevent users from reading files from the CUPS spool
		directory, where the file lives.

0.6;24 Aug 2004 Eliminated use of Qt Platinum style; not available with 
	        version of Qt shipped with Mandrake 10.0

0.5: 5 Apr 2004 Fixed bug:  backend script wouldn't ignore comments
	        in hyla.conf file; line with "#Host: foobar.com" wouldn't
		be ignored.

0.4:12 Feb 2004 Fixed bugs:  couldn't have single quotes in remarks, etc.
		Internal cover page wouldn't send if 'no cover page'
		was checked.  Internal cover page generation didn't use
		page size.  Correct need to exit twice from status display.
		Additional error checking.  Capture stderr from faxstat
		for display.  Fork status display so print queue isn't
		hung while waiting for user to quit status display.

0.3:25 Jan 2004 Check port to Solaris, improve check for MOC, UIC in
	      	acsite.m4, minor fix for Qt2, removed moc files from
	      	distribution (should be re-built at each site); 
		corrected backend script to limit prints to stdout
		so CUPS gets correct device info.  Corrected documentation
		to reflect what happens with correct backend script.

0.2:19 Jan 2004 Improved documentation
0.1:19 Jan 2004 Initial version.
